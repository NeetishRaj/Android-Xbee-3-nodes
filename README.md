# Android-Xbee-3-nodes
Three separate arduino codes for setting a mesh network for 3 arduino xbee modules with 2 having a LCD and Ultrasonic sensor
so the 3 nodes are

1. RSU co-ordinator sets up the PAN
Arduino Uno + Xbee S2C model with Digimesh function 

2.Emergency Vehicle as End-Unit
Arduino Uno + Xbee S2C model with Digimesh function as End-Device + JHD162A LCD(16x2)
 + HCSR-04 Ultrasonic sensor for obstacle detection

3.Normal Vehicle as End-Unit
Arduino Uno + Xbee S2C model with Digimesh function as End-Device + JHD162A LCD(16x2)
 + HCSR-04 Ultrasonic sensor for obstacle detection
